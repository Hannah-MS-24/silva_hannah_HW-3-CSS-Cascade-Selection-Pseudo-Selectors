# silva_hannah_HW-3-CSS-Cascade-Selection-Pseudo-Selectors

- This is a task management web application where I can track tasks across three categories: To Do, In Progress, and Done. I can interact with the tasks by checking off items when they are completed. The interface also includes space for additional observations or notes, such as reminders to stay hydrated, take breaks, or stay active.

## Instalation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the command:

3. Open the project in your preferred code editor, such as Visual Studio Code.

4. Ensure I have the necessary files for the project to run. This includes the HTML, CSS, and image assets.

- The main CSS file should be located at css/main.css.
